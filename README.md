### Hi I'm Jonathan ðŸ‘‹

I have spent the last 15+ years achieving success in Sales and Marketing. I dove head first into learning software development because my desire to create, my desire for technology to make our lives easier, and my desire to inspire my children. 

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a project intended to eliminate a friction point between sales and their prospects.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: My Coding Bootcamp experience or my other professional experience
- âš¡ Fun fact: I've led 2 sales presentations at the Pentagon.
